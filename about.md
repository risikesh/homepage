Hi! I am Risikesh Ravilichitty! I work at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com">Qualcomm</a> as Pre-Silicon Performace Engineer.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in">International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore</a> with a Integrated Mtech (BTech + MTech) Degree with a specialistion in VLSI & Systems in 2021.My interests lie in the area of computer systems mainly but sometimes wander around other domains in computer science and electronics, I'm exploring different niches in the field, will be bloging on it to understand how computers work :) .

In my free time i like to Read Blog's on Tech and Geo-Politics, and Cycle around the city in the morning ðŸš². I often mentor early Undergraduate students in CSE/ECE domains to help them navigate through broken education system(Feel free to ping me via mail/LinkedIn).
